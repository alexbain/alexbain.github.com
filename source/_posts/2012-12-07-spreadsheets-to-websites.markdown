This morning I came across a two interesting JavaScript libraries designed to help
make Google Spreadsheets a data source for websites. Given how simple it is to
get started creating a spreadsheet it seems like a great way to make that data
available for public viewing.

I can imagine this being extremely useful for someone who already maintains a
spreadsheet with carefully tabulated and calculated data who isn't interested
in repeatedly exporting / importing it into a database for web viewing.
