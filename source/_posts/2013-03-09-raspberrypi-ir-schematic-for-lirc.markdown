Here is a [simple schematic](http://upverter.com/alexbain/f24516375cfae8b9/Open-Source-Universal-Remote/) I designed that demonstrates you how you could create an IR transceiver for your RaspberryPi. You can use this schematic with the [LIRC](http://lirc.org) software package to create your own universal remote. It's hosted on [Upverter](http://upverter.com) and contains a parts list for where to purchase the parts I used.

If you have any suggestions for improvements feel free to tinker on it and submit them.

Interested in installing LIRC on your RaspberryPi? You may be interested in reading [Setting up LIRC on the RaspberryPi](/blog/2013/01/06/setting-up-lirc-on-the-raspberrypi/) and [Controlling LIRC From the Web](/blog/2013/02/23/controlling-lirc-from-the-web/).


**Update:** Thanks to Steve in the comments for pointing out a few errors I had in the schematic.
