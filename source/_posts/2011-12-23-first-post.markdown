Hi!

I've started this blog to document the things I find of interest in the realm of
front end web development (JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5), Ruby on Rails, and Cognitive Science.

My hope is that you'll find some of these posts either interesting or educational.

**This blog is powered by:**

* [Octopress][1]
* [GitHub Pages][2]

Considering Octopress? I'd recommend it. My first impressions of [Octopress][1]
are very positive. It's easy to setup, easy to configure, and very customizable.
As long as you're comfortable with the command line, [Markdown][3], and [GitHub][4],
it's a fantastic option.

As time goes on I'll be implementing some theme/front end tweaks I have in mind.

Want to look under the hood? Feel free to explore the [source code][5].

Thanks for stopping by. Please subscribe to the [RSS feed][6] to follow future updates.
