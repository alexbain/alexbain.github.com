`v0.3.0` of `lirc_web` has just been published to npm.

This release targets mobile optimizations and performance. `lirc_web` now behaves more like a native app when added to the home screen of a mobile device. A favicon is now shown on the home screen, the URL bar will be hidden from view, and `lirc_web` will be selectable from the device's multitasking screen. Furthermore, CSS assets are bundled into a single request, small images are now base64 encoded, and an application cache has been introduced to cache all assets locally between requests.

In my testing, with a warm cache, `lirc_web` now fires a `load` event within 300ms.

Here's the relevant piece of `CHANGELOG.md` that describes all updates since `v0.2.0`:

```

* Adds ability to set lirc socket in `config.json` (thanks @pmgration)
* Base64 `left-arrow.png` image to reduce a request
* Adds application cache manifest file for offline caching

## [0.2.4] - 2016-01-13

## [0.2.2] - 2016-01-01

## [0.2.1] - 2015-12-31
