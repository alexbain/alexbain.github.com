    <updated>2013-11-02T09:50:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://alexba.in/blog/2013/11/02/lirc-web-nginx-and-upstart</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I will cover how to start a NodeJS app (<code>lirc_web</code>) when a RaspberryPi boots up. This ensures that if the RaspberryPi ever loses power, the <code>lirc_web</code> app will restart when the system comes online. <code>lirc_web</code> is an open source NodeJS app I wrote as part of the <a href="http://opensourceuniversalremote.com">Open Source Universal Remote</a> project. If you&#8217;d like to learn more about the project, please check out <a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/06/08/open-source-universal-remote-parts-and-pictures/">Open Source Universal Remote - Parts &amp; Pictures</a>.</p>

<p>To accomplish this will take three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Configure the hostname for the RaspberryPi</li>
<li>Install and configure Upstart</li>
<li>Install and configure NGINX</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Note: Not all mobile devices support <code>.local</code> domains. You may still need to connect via IP.</strong></p>

<h3>Configure the hostname for the RaspberryPi</h3>

<p>If you want your RaspberryPi to be accessible on your local network via hostname, instead of always typing it&#8217;s IP address, you&#8217;ll want to install an mDNS daemon. If you&#8217;d like to learn why, I recommend reading <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/167190/how-and-why-to-assign-the-.local-domain-to-your-raspberry-pi/">How (and Why) to Assign the .local Domain to Your Raspberry Pi</a>. The RaspberryPi supports Avahi, which can be installed with:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon
</code></pre>

<p>When that finishes, try pinging <code>raspberrypi.local</code> from a different computer. Everything should just work. Next, we&#8217;ll update the hostname of the RaspberryPi to be <code>universalremote</code>. This requires three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Edit <code>/etc/hosts</code> and change the last line to <code>127.0.1.1 universalremote</code></li>
<li>Edit <code>/etc/hostname</code> and change the hostname to <code>universalremote</code></li>
<li>Reboot the RaspberryPi by running <code>sudu shutdown -r now</code></li>
</ol>


<p>After the RaspberryPi boots back up, you should be able to connect to the RaspberryPi via hostname (<code>http://universalremote.local</code>) or IP.</p>

<h3>Install and configure Upstart</h3>

<p>To ensure the <code>lirc_web</code> app starts when the RaspberryPi boots, we will use a tool called <a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com">Upstart</a>. Upstart is a project from Ubuntu that simplifies writing init scripts. If you want to learn more about it, you can visit <a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/">http://upstart.ubuntu.com/</a> and read more. RaspbianOS does not include Upstart by default, but it can be installed to replace sysvinit with no negative consequences. Here are the commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install upstart
# You will be asked to type 'Yes, do as I say!'
# You may see an error about initctl being unable to connect, which will be fixed after a reboot

# Reboot the RaspberryPi
sudo shutdown -r now
</code></pre>

<p>Once the RaspberryPi reboots Upstart should be installed. Upstart configuration files are placed in <code>/etc/init</code>. You can either use the sample Upstart configuration that comes with the <code>lirc_web</code> Git repository, or you can use this example (place in <code>/etc/init/open-source-universal-remote.conf</code>):</p>

<pre><code># /etc/init/open-source-universal-remote.conf
description "universalremote.local"

start on runlevel [2345]
stop on runlevel [016]

# Restart when job dies
respawn

# Give up restart after 5 respawns in 60 seconds
respawn limit 5 60

script

  echo $$ &gt; /var/run/open-source-universal-remote.pid
  exec /usr/local/bin/node /home/pi/lirc_web/app.js 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;&gt; /var/log/open-source-universal-remote.upstart.log

end script

pre-start script
    # Date format same as (new Date()).toISOString() for consistency
    echo "[`date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%T.%3NZ`] (sys) Starting" &gt;&gt; /var/log/open-source-universal-remote.upstart.log
end script

pre-stop script
    rm /var/run/open-source-universal-remote.pid
    echo "[`date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%T.%3NZ`] (sys) Stopping" &gt;&gt; /var/log/open-source-universal-remote.upstart.log
end script
</code></pre>

<p>After creating the Upstart script, you should be able to start the <code>lirc_web</code> project by running:</p>

<pre><code>sudo initctl start open-source-universal-remote
</code></pre>

<p>You can verify everything works by opening <code>http://universalremote.local:3000</code> (or the RaspberryPi&#8217;s IP address) in your web browser. You should see the <code>lirc_web</code> web interface.</p>

<h3>Install and Configure NGINX</h3>

<p>If you run <code>lirc_web</code> by itself it creates a basic web server on port 3000. This is fine, but it&#8217;s more convenient when an web application runs on port 80, the default port for web traffic. We&#8217;ll use the free and open source NGINX web server to accomplish this.</p>

<p>To install nginx and ensure it starts on boot, run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install nginx
update-rc.d nginx defaults
sudo service nginx start
</code></pre>

<p>When this completes, confirm everything installed correctly by trying to  access <code>http://universalremote.local</code> in your web browser. You should see a &#8220;Welcome to nginx!&#8221; web page.</p>

<p>Next, we have to configure nginx to serve the <code>lirc_web</code> app. You can use the sample config file included in the <code>lirc_web</code> Git repository (within the config directory), or use this example:</p>

<pre><code>server {
    listen            80;
    server_name       universalremote.local;

    # Change this to the location you installed lirc_web
    root              /home/pi/lirc_web;
    index             index.html index.htm;

    access_log        /var/log/open-source-universal-remote.nginx.log;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;

        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000/;
        proxy_redirect off;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Restart nginx to pick up the new configuration with <code>sudo service nginx restart</code>.</p>

<p>Now, if you visit <code>http://universalremote.local</code> in your web browser you should now see the project running. In the future, any time you reboot the RaspberryPi <code>lirc_web</code> will start automatically.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>If everything went smoothly you should now have a daemonzized version of <code>lirc_web</code> running on your RaspberryPi, which is being served via nginx over port 80. In addition, any time you restart your RaspberryPi the <code>lirc_web</code> app will start up at boot.</p>

<p>This past weekend I converted my <a href="http://opensourceuniversalremote.com">Open Source Universal Remote</a> breadboard layout into a more permanent soldered circuit. I used the <a href="http://octopart.com/ada801-adafruit+industries-27056076">Adafruit Protoboard</a> as a base instead of having a custom circuit board printed, which worked out well. The protoboard is perfectly sized for the RaspberryPi and I highly recommend it for any RaspberryPi related hardware projects.</p>

<p>Below, I&#8217;ve attached some high resolution photographs of the finished protoboard (front and back). I&#8217;ve also created separate versions of the photographs which are fully annotated and explain how all of the components are laid out. Please note that I did make one miscalculation in my circuit which I have corrected with a yellow jumper wire. I&#8217;ve pointed out the miscalculation on both annotated photographs.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post will serve as a guide to using a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">RaspberryPi</a>, a <a href="http://getpebble.com/">Pebble Watch</a>, and an Android phone (<a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/4/">Google Nexus 4</a>) to control your home theater from your wrist. The result is something like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://alexba.in/images/posts/open-source-universal-remote-pebble-watch.jpg" height="450px" width="600px" class="center" /></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>For a bit of backstory, around eighteen months ago I decided to start experimenting with and teaching myself electronics. I started working with an <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno">Arduino Uno</a> and eventually moved to a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">RasperryPi</a>. I wanted to build open hardware, open source, web connected devices and these seemed like the right tools for the job. I wanted to ensure that every device I built could, down the road, be controlled in entirely new ways with novel human computer interfaces like the <a href="http://getpebble.com">Pebble Watch</a>, <a href="https://www.thalmic.com/myo/?autoplay=true">Thalmic Labs Myo</a>, <a href="http://www.emotiv.com/">Emotiv EPOC EEG Headset</a>, <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/">Google Glass</a>, and others.</p>

<p>So, after some consideration, I chose to build a RaspberryPi powered device that controls all of the infrared devices in my home. This project has turned into the <a href="http://opensourceuniversalremote.com">Open Source Universal Remote</a>, an open hardware/open source device you can make yourself with a RaspberryPi and $10 of electronic parts. This post will discuss how I wired up my Pebble Watch to control my Open Source Universal remote using my Android phone.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get started!</p>

<h3>Outline</h3>

<ul>
<li>Part 0: How it Works</li>
<li>Part 1: Open Source Universal Remote</li>
<li>Part 2: The Android Phone</li>
<li>Part 3: The Pebble Watch</li>
<li>Part 4: Conclusion / What&#8217;s next</li>
</ul>


<h3>Part 0: How it Works</h3>

<p>At a high level, the project works like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>User taps button on Pebble Watch.</li>
<li>Pebble Watch tells Android phone that a button has been tapped.</li>
<li>Android phone makes web request to Open Source Universal Remote API.</li>
<li>Open Source Universal Remote receives web request and sends out infrared pulses.</li>
<li>Home theater device detects infrared pulses and responds accordingly.</li>
</ol>


<p>I&#8217;ll work backwards from the Open Source Universal Remote to the Pebble Watch.</p>

<h3>Part 1: Open Source Universal Remote</h3>

<p><img src="http://alexba.in/images/posts/open-source-universal-remote.jpg" height="320px" width="640px" class="center" /></p>

<p>The foundation of this project is the <a href="http://opensourceuniversalremote.com">Open Source Universal Remote</a>. I won&#8217;t be going into detail about how to make one here, but if you&#8217;re interested in learning more or making your own, here is all the information you need:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://opensourceuniversalremote.com">Open Source Universal Remote</a> - The open source universal remote home page. This is an overview of the project and how it works.</li>
<li><a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/01/04/raspberrypi-quickstart/">RaspberryPi QuickStart</a> - A guide I wrote to purchasing and doing the initial configuration on a RaspberryPi.</li>
<li><a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/01/06/setting-up-lirc-on-the-raspberrypi/">Setting up LIRC on the RaspberryPi</a> - How to setup and install the <a href="http://lirc.org">Linux Infrared Remote Control (LIRC)</a> software on the RaspberryPi</li>
<li><a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/02/23/controlling-lirc-from-the-web/">Controlling LIRC from the Web</a> - How to install and configure two open source projects I wrote (<a href="https://github.com/alexbain/lirc_node">lirc_node</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alexbain/lirc_web">lirc_web</a>) to enable you to control LIRC from the web.</li>
<li><a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/06/08/open-source-universal-remote-parts-and-pictures/">Open Source Universal Remote - Parts &amp; Picturse</a> - Finalized parts list and build pictures from a protoboard I soldered together.</li>
</ol>


<p>For this project, I&#8217;ll be using the HTTP based API that the Open Source Universal Remote generates based on the remotes and commands you teach it. Here are the three URLs I used for this project:</p>

<pre><code>http://192.168.1.115:3000/remotes/Yamaha/power
http://192.168.1.115:3000/remotes/Microsoft_xbox360/onoff
http://192.168.1.115:3000/remotes/sonytv/power
</code></pre>

<p>You could get clever and use the hostname of the open source remote, I&#8217;m just using the static IP address here.</p>

<h3>Part 2: The Android Phone</h3>

<p>The second component of this project is an Android phone with the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm">Tasker</a> app installed on it. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm">Tasker</a> is a great app that provides a rich way to control your Android phone. One of the functions is the ability to send HTTP POST requests to specific URLs, which is the feature we&#8217;ll be using for this project.</p>

<p>Within the Tasker app you&#8217;ll need to create three new tasks, one for each button on the Pebble watch. Each task should be created with a descriptive name (like &#8220;Yamaha Power&#8221;) and will contain a single <code>HTTP POST</code> action (found in the <code>Net</code> menu), which will be sent to the open source remote. Here&#8217;s where the <code>HTTP POST</code> action can be found:</p>

<p><img src="http://alexba.in/images/posts/tasker-http-post.jpg" height="640px" width="384px" class="center" /></p>

<p>The <code>HTTP POST</code> action should be setup like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://alexba.in/images/posts/tasker-action-example.jpg" height="640px" width="384px" class="center" /></p>

<pre><code># IP / Port of the Open Source Universal Remote
Server:Port   http://192.168.1.115:3000

# Path to the remote/command combo you want to call
Path          /remotes/Yamaha/power
</code></pre>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve created those three Tasks, you&#8217;re ready to setup the Pebble Watch.</p>

<h3>Part 3: Pebble Watch</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://getpebble.com">Pebble Watch</a> was a successful Kickstarter project that launched in 2012. It&#8217;s a smart watch which connects to your cell phone via Bluetooth. It has a software development kit enabling anyone to write apps for the watch. I participated in the Kickstarter project, and have been very excited to start using my watch as a &#8220;remote control for reality.&#8221;</p>

<p>For this project we&#8217;ll be using the Android/Pebble combo app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kodek.pebbletasker">PebbleTasker</a>. This is a very straightforward app. You install the app on your phone, which gives you the option to install the PebbleTasker app on the watch.</p>

<p>Once the watch app has been installed, you use the Android app to define which Tasker actions should be assigned to which button. Select the three Tasker actions that you created above and you should be set!</p>

<p><img src="http://alexba.in/images/posts/pebble-tasker.jpg" height="640px" width="384px" class="center" /></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a photograph of my Pebble Watch with the above Tasker actions programmed into the watch:</p>

<p><img src="http://alexba.in/images/posts/open-source-universal-remote-pebble-watch-2.jpg" height="450px" width="600px" class="center" /></p>

<h3>Part 4: Conclusion / What&#8217;s Next</h3>

<p>Not to wax too philosophical, but I believe that next generation user interface devices like the Pebble Watch have the potential to transform how humans interact with the digital world. The cell phone was revolutionary - it enabled humans to interact with their data while away from a desktop or laptop computer. Now, devices like the Pebble Watch and the RaspberryPi allow you to move beyond the phone and begin interacting with the digital world in an entirely new way.</p>

<p>As additional web connected devices are made that control lights, garage doors, cars, appliances, and beyond, the interplay between those devices and user interface devices like the Pebble Watch, Myo, Emotiv EPOC, Google Glass, and others are going to give us new and powerful interactions to control the digital and physical world. These interactions were, until now, the stuff of science fiction. These are exciting times we live in.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of the <a href="http://opensourceuniversalremote.com">Open Source Universal Remote</a> project I&#8217;ve been creating a simple and touch friendly user interface for LIRC. In a previous post I covered <a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/02/23/controlling-lirc-from-the-web/">Controlling LIRC From the Web</a>, where I introduced version 0.0.1 of <a href="http://github.com/alexbain/lirc_web">lirc_web</a>. Lirc_web is a simple NodeJS app I created for controlling LIRC from the web.</p>

<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve created a set of UI styles and fixed a number of touch related bugs with the project. I&#8217;m excited to announce <a href="http://github.com/alexbain/lirc_web">v0.0.3 of lirc_web</a> which is now on GitHub.</p>

<p>Here is a screen shot of the remote listing page:</p>

<p><img src="http://alexba.in/images/posts/universal-remote/lirc_web_v003_remotes.png" class="center" /></p>

<p>Upon tapping on any remote, you&#8217;ll be taken to a page that shows all known commands for that remote:</p>

<p><img src="http://alexba.in/images/posts/universal-remote/lirc_web_v003_commands.png" class="center" /></p>

<p>I have a long list of intended improvements, so if you&#8217;re interested in contributing to the project please let me know. As always, if you discover any bugs or have any feedback, please let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>Almost a year ago I decided to teach myself electronics by creating my own WiFi enabled universal remote. Initially I tried to build the project with an Arduino, but later switched to a RaspberryPi. As I&#8217;ve made progress on my project I&#8217;ve open sourced the software I&#8217;ve written and blogged about every step of the process.</p>

<p>To date, I&#8217;ve had over nine thousand unique visitors check out the posts related to this project. Based on the positive feedback I&#8217;ve received and the questions asked, I believe it makes sense to aggregate all of the data I&#8217;ve spread out across numerous blog posts into one guide. Over the coming weeks I&#8217;ll be creating a step by step guide for building your own RaspberryPi powered universal remote. In addition, I&#8217;ll be creating and open sourcing additional components of the project such as a printed circuit board and a 3D printable case to enclose the project.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://opensourceuniversalremote.com">Open Source Universal Remote</a> landing page I created for the project. In the coming weeks I&#8217;ll be adding additional content to that page.</p>

<p>If you have any requests or ideas for this project please don&#8217;t hesitate to ask in the comments. In addition, if you have hardware engineering experience or industrial design experience and would like to contribute please get in touch.</p>

    <updated>2013-02-23T13:06:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://alexba.in/blog/2013/02/23/controlling-lirc-from-the-web</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I will cover how to create a web interface + API for <a href="http://lirc.org">LIRC</a>, the Linux Infrared Remote Control project. I will be using NodeJS and a RaspberryPi in this post, but the ideas generalize to other languages and hardware. This post will serve as Part 3 of my open source universal remote project posts. If you haven&#8217;t had an opportunity to read the first two posts, I suggest checking out <a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2012/07/08/universal-remote-experiments/">Universal remote experiments</a> (Part 1) and <a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/01/06/setting-up-lirc-on-the-raspberrypi">Setting up LIRC on the RaspberryPi</a> (Part 2) before proceeding. You may also want to read <a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/01/15/installing-nodejs-on-your-raspberrypi">Installing NodeJS on your RaspberryPi</a>, where I cover installing NodeJS.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re completely new to the RaspberryPi and want to learn more I wrote a <a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/01/04/raspberrypi-quickstart">RaspberryPi Quickstart</a> post which covers everything from purchasing the parts to configuring the WiFi. Check that out if you&#8217;re new to the RaspberryPi ecosystem.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let&#8217;s get started!</p>

<p><img src="http://alexba.in/images/posts/universal-remote/ir-leds.jpg" class="center" /></p>

<h3>Why a web interface + API?</h3>

<p>LIRC is an awesome open source project that handles all of the low level requirements of sending and receiving Infrared commands from a Linux computer. It&#8217;s well documented, well supported, and thanks to the work of the open source community there is now a <code>lirc_rpi</code> driver included in the latest version of RaspbianOS. This means that, as long as you&#8217;re running a RaspberryPi with the latest OS and firmware, LIRC can interface with the RaspberryPi GPIO pins. Fantastic.</p>

<p>Once you have LIRC installed and configured (which I cover in my <a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/01/06/setting-up-lirc-on-the-raspberrypi">Setting up LIRC on the RaspberryPi</a> post), you can use LIRC executables like <a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/irsend.html">irsend</a> and <a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/irrecord.html">irrecord</a> to send and record IR commands for all your IR devices - right from the command line! This is great fun, but not very user friendly.</p>

<p>I wanted a way to control LIRC from the web. I wanted a web application that enabled me to interact with LIRC from any web connected device. If I had that, I could create a mobile web app for my phone, a regular web app for a desktop, and a RESTful API for web services. The API would give me a way to connect LIRC with any external web service - opening the door for future integrations. All I needed to do was find a way to call LIRC commands from within a web application.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the meat of this post. Getting NodeJS and LIRC to talk.</p>

<p><img src="http://alexba.in/images/posts/universal-remote/breadboard-wires.jpg" class="center" /></p>

<h3>Getting LIRC and NodeJS to talk</h3>

<p>To make LIRC usable from the web I needed a client library in a language I could build a web application in. The client library would provide some way to make calls from the web application to LIRC. This would give me the building blocks I needed to build a web application. The usual web languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, and NodeJS.</p>

<p>For this project I chose to work in NodeJS. If you would prefer to implement a web application in a different language, I found two existing LIRC client libraries. Sadly, neither seem maintained. I found <a href="https://github.com/fugalh/lircr">lircr</a> for Ruby and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pylirc/">pyLirc</a> for Python.</p>

<p>Since I could not find an existing NodeJS LIRC client library, and the existing libraries I did find were not up to date, I built my own. I created <a href="https://github.com/alexbain/lirc_node">lirc_node</a>, a lightweight NodeJS client library that interfaces with LIRC. v0.0.1 of <code>lirc_node</code> only supports <code>irsend</code>. This allows you to send IR commands to devices that LIRC knows about.</p>

<p>Before trying to install and use <code>lirc_node</code> make sure you have completed these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Purchased, setup, and configured a RaspberryPi to join a network</li>
<li>Wired up an IR LED and an IR Receiver to your RaspberryPi</li>
<li>Installed and configured LIRC to interface with your IR LED and IR Receiver</li>
<li>Programmed LIRC to understand your remote controls</li>
<li>Installed NodeJS on your RaspberryPi</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have not completed all of those steps scroll back to the top of this post and check out my earlier posts. I have written detailed step by step guides to get you through each of those steps.</p>

<p>All caught up? Great! We&#8217;re ready to install a basic web application for LIRC.</p>

<p><img src="http://alexba.in/images/posts/universal-remote/ir-receiver.jpg" class="center" /></p>

<h3>Creating a NodeJS web application using <code>lirc_node</code> and <code>lirc_web</code></h3>

<p>The easiest way to setup a NodeJS web application using <code>lirc_node</code> is to use v0.0.1 of <a href="https://github.com/alexbain/lirc_web">lirc_web</a>, a sample NodeJS application I wrote as a proof of concept for <code>lirc_node</code>. This web application is extremely basic, and only proves that <code>lirc_node</code> works. I have plans to grow this application with additional functionality and an improved interface. You may also use the basic API included in this web application to connect your universal remote with services like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;hl=en">Tasker</a> or <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>.</p>

<p>To download and install <a href="https://github.com/alexbain/lirc_web">lirc_web</a>:</p>

<pre><code>wget https://github.com/alexbain/lirc_web/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
mv lirc_web-master lirc_web
rm master.zip
cd lirc_web
npm install
node app.js
</code></pre>

<p>That should do it. Now, visit <code>http://raspberrypi:3000/</code> (or the IP address of your RaspberryPi) to confirm the sample web application shows all of the remotes and commands LIRC knows about. Clicking any of the links will tell LIRC to send that IR command via the API endpoint.</p>

<p><img src="http://alexba.in/images/posts/universal-remote/lirc_web.jpg" class="center" /></p>

<h3>Success!</h3>

<p>At this point, assuming you&#8217;ve been able to get each step working, you should have a web application you can use to control any IR device that LIRC knows about.</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s next?</h3>

<p>In the coming months I hope to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create an open hardware schematic and PCB board that anyone can use for the hardware.</li>
<li>3D print an enclosure for the RaspberryPi + expansion board.</li>
<li>Improve the web application and give it a proper mobile web interface.</li>
<li>Write about how to connect <a href="https://github.com/alexbain/lirc_web">lirc_web</a> to Tasker or IFTTT.</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://alexba.in/blog/2013/01/15/installing-nodejs-on-your-raspberrypi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s how I installed <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> on my RaspberryPi:</p>

<h3>Upgrade to the latest OS / Firmware</h3>

<p>If you have not already upgraded to the latest version of Raspbian OS and the
latest RaspberryPi firmware, I recommend following my <a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/01/04/raspberrypi-quickstart/">RaspberryPi Quickstart</a>.</p>

<h3>Getting and Compiling NodeJS</h3>

<p>Once your RaspberryPi is up to date, here&#8217;s how to download and compile NodeJS:</p>

<pre><code># Install some prerequisites
sudo apt-get install python g++ make

# Grab the latest version of NodeJS
mkdir ~/nodejs &amp;&amp; cd $_
wget -N http://nodejs.org/dist/node-latest.tar.gz
tar xzvf node-latest.tar.gz &amp;&amp; cd `ls -rd node-v*`

# Compile and install to your RaspberryPi
./configure
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that it takes about two hours to compile NodeJS.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are five steps to follow if you want to start using a RaspberryPi to power a company dashboard. I&#8217;ve just finished putting this together at my office. We&#8217;re using <a href="http://www.geckoboard.com">Geckoboard</a> for the web interface:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://alexba.in/images/posts/raspberrypi-dashboard.jpg" /></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://alexba.in/images/posts/raspberrypi-dashboard-2.jpg" /></p>

<h3>0: Make sure your RaspberryPi is fully updated</h3>

<p>Before you get started I highly recommend you follow my <a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/01/04/raspberrypi-quickstart/">RaspberryPi Quickstart</a> guide to get your RaspberryPi updated to the latest OS and Firmware. That post also includes links to the case and peripherals I purchased for this project.</p>

<h3>1: Install Chromium</h3>

<p>First, you&#8217;ll want to install Chromium on your RaspberryPi. We&#8217;ll be using Chromium to load the dashboard. I&#8217;ve also included the <code>ttf-mscorefonts-installer</code> package so things render nicely.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install chromium ttf-mscorefonts-installer
</code></pre>

<h3>2: Boot into X11 automatically</h3>

<p>You&#8217;ll want to make sure your RaspberryPi immediately boots into X11.</p>

<pre><code>sudo raspi-config
</code></pre>

<p>Scroll down to <code>boot_behavior</code> and hit enter. Make sure &#8220;Yes&#8221; is marked and hit enter again.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re done here, so scroll to Finish (right arrow key) and hit enter.</p>

<h3>3: Start Chromium on boot</h3>

<p>Third, you&#8217;ll want to make sure Chromium starts in kiosk (full screen, no user interface) as soon as your RaspberryPi boots up.</p>

<p>Create (or modify) <code>~/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart</code> and add the line:</p>

<pre><code>chromium --kiosk http://url_to_your_dashboard.com --incognito
</code></pre>

<p>Kiosk mode boots Chromium into full screen mode, by default. Incognito mode prevents a &#8220;Chrome did not shutdown cleanly&#8221; message from appearing on the top if the RaspberryPi loses power.</p>

<h3>4: Make sure the screen does not go to sleep</h3>

<p>Dashboards aren&#8217;t very useful if the screen goes into standy after ten minutes.</p>

<p>Edit <code>/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart</code> and make sure the <code>@xscreensaver</code> line is commented out. In addition, we&#8217;ll be adding three options that prevent the screen from going blank:</p>

<pre><code>#@xscreensaver -no-splash
@xset s off
@xset -dpms
@xset s noblank
</code></pre>

<p>I also needed to modify <code>/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf</code>. Add this line to the <code>[SeatDefaults]</code> section:</p>

<pre><code>xserver-command=X -s 0 dpms
</code></pre>

<h3>5: Hide the mouse cursor</h3>

<p>There&#8217;s no reason to keep the mouse cursor stuck in the middle of the screen.  We&#8217;ll use the unclutter utility to hide it after boot.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install unclutter
</code></pre>

<p>You&#8217;ll need to add this to your <code>~/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>unclutter -idle 0
</code></pre>

<h3>Enjoy!</h3>

<p>Reboot your RaspberryPi and it should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boot directly into X11</li>
<li>Start Chromium in kiosk mode and load up your dashboard</li>
<li>Prevent the screen from going to sleep after 10 minutes</li>
<li>Hide the mouse cursor</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preface</h3>

<p>In July 2012 I wrote a post called <a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2012/07/08/universal-remote-experiments/">Universal remote experiments</a> about creating a web controlled universal remote from the electronics up. The first platform I started with was an Arduino Uno. After much experimentation I learned that asking an Arduino to maintain a WiFi connection, maintain a TCP socket with a host computer, and send/receive IR signals was a bit much. With the limited memory and storage I had a hard time managing memory and keeping the system stable. I was, however, able to build a functional prototype:</p>

<p><img src="http://alexba.in/images/posts/arduino-ir.jpg" class="center" /></p>

<p>At the end of that post I had decided to rebuild the project on a RaspberryPi. I chose the RaspberryPi because I wanted a single device to host a web server in addition to being able to handle the IR transmitting and receiving. Given that the RaspberryPi runs Linux I could rely on it&#8217;s stable TCP/IP implementation and use open source software packages like nginx and NodeJS to build a web application.</p>

<p>This post will serve as &#8216;part two&#8217; of that project and cover how to install and configure LIRC on a RaspberryPi.</p>

<h3>LIRC - Linux Infrared Remote Control</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.lirc.org/">LIRC</a> is a mature and stable open source library that provides the ability to send and receive IR commands. Thanks to the contributions of <a href="http://aron.ws/">ar0n</a>, LIRC support is now included by default in the latest version of Raspbian OS. If you&#8217;d like to see the details of the RaspberryPi GPIO integration check out the <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/pull/152">pull request</a> he opened for it a while back.</p>

<h3>Setting up LIRC on the RaspberryPi</h3>

<p>Getting LIRC setup on the RaspberryPi is significantly easier now than it was six months ago.</p>

<p>You must be running on the latest firmware and OS for this guide to work. If you&#8217;re new to the RaspberryPi, or you haven&#8217;t upgraded to the latest firmware and OS, I recommend following my <a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/01/04/raspberrypi-quickstart/">RaspberryPi Quickstart</a> guide to get your RaspberryPi up and running on the latest OS and firmware.</p>

<p>First, we&#8217;ll need to install and configure LIRC to run on the RaspberryPi:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install lirc
</code></pre>

<p>You have to modify two files before you can start testing the receiver and IR LED. I modified these files based on a thread I found on the RaspberryPi forums. If you would like to read more about these changes please check out the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=45&amp;t=7798&amp;start=100">LIRC GPIO driver for homebrew adapter</a> thread. In particular, read through the posts by <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16815">rudiratlos</a> on page five, as he posts his configuration files.</p>

<p>Add this to your <code>/etc/modules</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>lirc_dev
lirc_rpi gpio_in_pin=23 gpio_out_pin=22
</code></pre>

<p>Change your <code>/etc/lirc/hardware.conf</code> file to:</p>

<pre><code>########################################################
# /etc/lirc/hardware.conf
#
# Arguments which will be used when launching lircd
LIRCD_ARGS="--uinput"

# Don't start lircmd even if there seems to be a good config file
# START_LIRCMD=false

# Don't start irexec, even if a good config file seems to exist.
# START_IREXEC=false

# Try to load appropriate kernel modules
LOAD_MODULES=true

# Run "lircd --driver=help" for a list of supported drivers.
DRIVER="default"
# usually /dev/lirc0 is the correct setting for systems using udev
DEVICE="/dev/lirc0"
MODULES="lirc_rpi"

# Default configuration files for your hardware if any
LIRCD_CONF=""
LIRCMD_CONF=""
########################################################
</code></pre>

<p>Now restart <code>lircd</code> so it picks up these changes:</p>

<pre><code>sudo /etc/init.d/lirc stop
sudo /etc/init.d/lirc start
</code></pre>

<h3>Wiring up the IR transceiver</h3>

<p><strong>June 8th 2013 Update:</strong> I&#8217;ve finished a more permanent build and documented the process in my <a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/06/08/open-source-universal-remote-parts-and-pictures/">Open Source Universal Remote - Parts &amp; Picturse</a> blog post.</p>

<p><strong>March 9th 2013 Update:</strong> I have formalized the schematic and parts list that I&#8217;m using and have made it available on <a href="http://upverter.com">Upverter</a>. Please read <a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/03/09/raspberrypi-ir-schematic-for-lirc/">RaspberryPi IR Schematic for LIRC</a> for more details.</p>

<p>To send and receive IR signals from your RaspberryPi you&#8217;ll need to wire up an IR LED and an IR receiver and tell LIRC where to find them. Here are the parts I purchased for my own project:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/387">940nm IR LED 20deg</a> - 20 degree viewing angle. Bright and tuned to 940nm wavelength</li>
<li><a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/IR333C/1080-1081-ND/2675572?WT.z_cid=ref_octopart_dkc_buynow">940nm IR LED 40deg</a> - 40 degree viewing angle. Bright and tuned to 940nm wavelength.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/157">38khz IR Receiver</a> - Receives IR signals at remote control frequencies</li>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/756">PN2222 Transistor</a> - Transistor to help drive IR LED</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8374">10k Ohm resistor</a> - Resistor that goes between rPi GPIO and the PN2222 transistor</li>
</ul>


<p>If you don&#8217;t already have wires and a breadboard to prototype with, you may be interested in:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://adafruit.com/products/942">Mounting plate + breadboard</a> - A mounting plate + breadboard for your RaspberryPi</li>
<li><a href="http://adafruit.com/products/914">Adafruit Pi Cobbler Breakout Kit</a> - Breakout kit for getting the GPIO pins onto the breadboard</li>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/153">Breadboard wire bundle</a> - Bundle of wires to use in the breadboard</li>
</ul>


<p>For this project I wired up the IR LED to GPIO pin 22 and the IR Receiver to GPIO pin 23. You&#8217;ll see that mentioned in the <code>/etc/modules</code> file above.</p>

<p>Please check out these diagrams for information and schematics about how to wire everything up:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/03/09/raspberrypi-ir-schematic-for-lirc/">RasperryPi IR Schematic for LIRC</a> - My own schematic, which I&#8217;ve been using myself.</li>
<li><a href="http://aron.ws/projects/lirc_rpi/">RaspberryPi lirc_rpi</a> - Contains hardware and schematics for the raspberryPi</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/tvbgone/design.html">TV-B-Gone Schematic</a> - Info on wiring up IR leds / receivers</li>

</ul>


<p>Here&#8217;s a picture of my initial schematic (<a href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/03/09/raspberrypi-ir-schematic-for-lirc/">view the updated one here</a>) wired up to my RaspberryPi with all of the components tested and working:</p>

<p><img src="http://alexba.in/images/posts/raspberrypi-ir.jpg" class="center" /></p>

<h3>Testing the IR receiver</h3>

<p>Testing the IR receiver is relatively straightforward.</p>

<p>Run these two commands to stop <code>lircd</code> and start outputting raw data from the IR receiver:</p>

<pre><code>sudo /etc/init.d/lirc stop
mode2 -d /dev/lirc0
</code></pre>

<p>Point a remote control at your IR receiver and press some buttons. You should see something like this:</p>

<pre><code>space 16300
pulse 95
space 28794
pulse 80
space 19395
pulse 83
space 402351
pulse 135
space 7085
pulse 85
space 2903
</code></pre>

<p>If you don&#8217;t, something is probably incorrectly configured. Triple check that you&#8217;ve connected everything properly and haven&#8217;t crossed any wires. I highly recommend referring to the schematics I linked to above. There is also some trouble shooting advice in the RaspberryPi Forum thread I linked to above. Finally - you may want to do this in a dark room. I found that my desk lamp and overhead light would cause the IR receiver to think it was receiving valid signals.</p>

<h3>Testing the IR LED</h3>

<p>You&#8217;re going to need to either find an existing LIRC config file for your remote control or use your IR receiver to generate a new LIRC config file. In my case I created a new LIRC config file. To do this, read the documentation on the <a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/irrecord.html">irrecord</a> application that comes with LIRC.</p>

<p>When using irrecord it will ask you to name the buttons you&#8217;re programming as you program them. Be sure to run <code>irrecord --list-namespace</code> to see the valid names before you begin.</p>

<p>Here were the commands that I ran to generate a remote configuration file:</p>

<pre><code># Stop lirc to free up /dev/lirc0
sudo /etc/init.d/lirc stop

# Create a new remote control configuration file (using /dev/lirc0) and save the output to ~/lircd.conf
irrecord -d /dev/lirc0 ~/lircd.conf

# Make a backup of the original lircd.conf file
sudo mv /etc/lirc/lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd_original.conf

# Copy over your new configuration file
sudo cp ~/lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd.conf

# Start up lirc again
sudo /etc/init.d/lirc start
</code></pre>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve completed a remote configuration file and saved/added it to <code>/etc/lirc/lircd.conf</code> you can try testing the IR LED. We&#8217;ll be using the <a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/irsend.html">irsend</a> application that comes with LIRC to facilitate sending commands. You&#8217;ll definitely want to check out the documentation to learn more about the options <code>irsend</code> has.</p>

<p>Here are the commands I ran to test my IR LED (using the &#8220;yamaha&#8221; remote configuration file I created):</p>

<pre><code># List all of the commands that LIRC knows for 'yamaha'
irsend LIST yamaha ""

# Send the KEY_POWER command once
irsend SEND_ONCE yamaha KEY_POWER

# Send the KEY_VOLUMEDOWN command once
irsend SEND_ONCE yamaha KEY_VOLUMEDOWN
</code></pre>

<p>I tested that this was working by pointing the IR led at my Yamaha receiver and testing whether I could turn it on and adjust the volume.</p>

<h3>Success!</h3>

<p>That&#8217;s it! You&#8217;ve now successfully installed and configured LIRC on your RaspberryPi. You can add additional remote control configuration files to your <code>/etc/lirc/lircd.conf</code> file to control multiple remotes.</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<p>Here&#8217;s a few resources to explore if you&#8217;d like to learn more:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lirc.org">lirc</a> - LIRC home page</li>
<li><a href="http://aron.ws/projects/lirc_rpi/">RaspberryPi lirc_rpi GPIO driver</a> - ar0n&#8217;s lirc_rpi page</li>
<li><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=45&amp;t=7798&amp;start=100">LIRC GPIO driver for homebrew adapter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/tvbgone/design.html">TV-B-Gone Schematic</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>My next steps</h3>

<p>The next step for my web controlled universal remote project is going to be finding or creating remote files for all of the IR devices in my house. Once I&#8217;ve gathered all of those files together and placed them in the <code>lircd.conf</code> file I&#8217;ll begin work on the web application server.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll cover all of that in a future post.</p>

<h3>Questions? Comments?</h3>

<p>Please let me know if you have any questions or run into any trouble while running through these steps. All of these steps were tested and working on the date this post was published.</p>

    <link href="http://alexba.in/blog/2013/01/04/raspberrypi-quickstart/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-04T20:08:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://alexba.in/blog/2013/01/04/raspberrypi-quickstart</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently had the opportunity to purchase and setup a second RaspberryPi system. Here&#8217;s a very brief shopping list and collection of links to get your own RaspberryPi system setup.</p>

<h3>Parts List</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009SQQF9C/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i01">RaspberryPi</a> - 512MB version</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008TCUXLW/ref=oh_details_o01_s01_i01">Enclosure for the RaspberryPi</a> - Clear and contains cutous for all of the ports + GPIO pins.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X26PMO/ref=oh_details_o01_s01_i02">WiFi Card</a> - Drivers are included in the latest Raspbian distribution.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VNKNEG/ref=oh_details_o01_s01_i03">8GB Class 10 SD card</a> - Class 10 cards have a fast read / write speed.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ES5ZSW/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00">USB A to USB MicroB cable</a> - The &#8216;power cable&#8217; for the RaspberryPi</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CG2ATQ/ref=oh_details_o01_s01_i00">USB power supply</a> - High powered USB power supply to drive the RaspberryPi + WiFi card.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-Meters/dp/B003L1ZYYM">HDMI cable</a> - HDMI cable to connect to HDTV / monitor.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Setting up the SD card</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download the latest <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">Rasbian linux image</a>.</li>
<li>Setup the SD card by following the <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup">RPi Easy SD Card Setup</a> guide.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Booting it all up</h3>

<p>Plug everything in, boot up the system. If you&#8217;re planning to SSH into the RaspberryPi via Ethernet (instead of using a keyboard/mouse/monitor) you&#8217;ll have to log into your router and determine what it&#8217;s IP address is.</p>

<p>The default RaspberryPi login is username <code>pi</code> with password <code>raspberry</code>. You&#8217;ll probably want to change this.</p>

<h3>Expanding the root partition</h3>

<p><strong>Update: April 12th 2013</strong>: Thanks to Conky (and Kevin) for suggesting this.</p>

<p>Once your RaspberryPi boots up, you&#8217;ll want to adjust the root partition to take up the entire SD card. This will help prevent errors about the file system being full once you start updating packages and installing new packages:</p>

<pre><code># Open the RaspiConfig tool:
sudo raspi-config

# Navigate to the "expand_rootfs" option and select it
# Quit out of the raspi-config screen

# Reboot the system:
sudo shutdown -r now
</code></pre>

<h3>Setting up the WiFi</h3>

<p>Assuming everything booted up okay, you&#8217;re ready to setup the wireless. To setup the wireless card to connect to your WPA/WPA2 secured wireless network, edit <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> and add this to the bottom of the file. You may need to remove some existing configuration for <code>wlan0</code>.</p>

<pre><code>allow-hotplug wlan0
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
    wpa-ssid YOUR_SSID
    wpa-psk YOUR_PASSWORD
</code></pre>

<p>Save this file, and run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ifdown wlan0
sudo ifup wlan0
</code></pre>

<p>Run <code>ifconfig</code> and you should see that <code>wlan0</code> has an IP address.</p>

<h3>Setting up NTP</h3>

<p>Accurate time is useful.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ntpdate
sudo ntpdate -u ntp.ubuntu.com
</code></pre>

<h3>Updating Raspbian OS</h3>

<p>After everything is setup you&#8217;ll probably want to update Raspbian to the latest packages and version.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
</code></pre>

<h3>Updating the RaspberryPi&#8217;s firmware</h3>

<p>To update the firmware to the latest version, we&#8217;ll use <a href="https://www.github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update">Hexxeh&#8217;s rpi-update script</a>.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install git-core
sudo wget http://goo.gl/1BOfJ -O /usr/bin/rpi-update &amp;&amp; sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/rpi-update
sudo rpi-update
</code></pre>

<h3>You&#8217;re done!</h3>

<p>At this point you should be completely setup and operational.</p>

<p>If you had any troubles with this please let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>Here are some resources to do further reading:</p>

This user agent stylesheet rule was being applied in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.</p>

<p>Here is the <code>user agent stylesheet</code> rule that was being applied:</p>

<pre><code>input:not([type="image"]), textarea {

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been enamored with space for as long as I can remember. The barrier of entry
for space/satellites, however, has always been a bit outside of the individual&#8217;s grasp.</p>

<p>Until now. The other day I stumbled across an amazing Kickstarter project -
the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575960623/ardusat-your-arduino-experiment-in-space">ArduSat</a>. The goal of the project is to be the first open platform for
individuals to design and run their own space experiments. Yup. That&#8217;s right.
For $325 you can now run your own space experiments.</p>

<p>For the first time you can get access to a satellite and execute whatever code
you like to gather data, run experiments, or otherwise just take photos from space.
It&#8217;s an amazing idea and one I&#8217;m proud to say I&#8217;m a backer of.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t decided what to do with the time yet. Since photography is such
a passion of mine, however, I&#8217;d love to find some way to analyze the surroundings,
determine if something interesting is happening, and start taking photographs. Given
that the user has good control over the camera I was thinking that some HDR shots
might end up being beautiful.</p>

<p>Hopefully my output from this will be a beautiful print I can hang in my home
to remember the first (of many, I can only hope) time I was able to run code in space.</p>

    <updated>2012-07-08T09:51:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://alexba.in/blog/2012/07/08/universal-remote-experiments</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few months I&#8217;ve decided to teach myself a bit about embedded
microcontrollers and electronics. I&#8217;ve never worked with hardware before and,
after a bit of Googling, found an amazing Maker / Open Hardware movement going
on that I could leverage to help bootstrap my ideas.</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;ve found the best way to motivate myself is with a concrete project I
decided that, for my first project, I wanted to build a universal remote that I
could control from my phone. I have a Harmony remote, which I use regularly,
but it&#8217;s limited by line of sight and requires customization through a
cumbersome software interface.</p>

<p>My initial requirements were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Must be small enough to place discreetly in the room</li>
<li>Must be WiFi enabled</li>
<li>Must have great IR range and coverage</li>
<li>Must be able to learn existing commands</li>
<li>Must have a responsive web interface</li>
</ul>


<h4>Version 1: Arduino</h4>

<p>The first prototype I built was using an <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino Uno</a> microcontroller along with
<a href="http://www.arcfn.com/2009/08/multi-protocol-infrared-remote-library.html">Ken Shirriff&#8217;s</a> multi protocol IR library. I had wired a 940nm IR LED to one
of the Arduino&#8217;s pins and was able to get about two feet of range out of it.</p>

<p>Next, I extended the code and attached a <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10822">Roving Networks RN-XV</a> WiFi chip to
my project so it was WiFi enabled. So far so good. I could now send or receive
IR commands (relatively well, it wasn&#8217;t perfect) over Wifi with about a two foot
range for the IR signal. I also had to hard code the WiFi credentials which meant
the device wasn&#8217;t very portable, but at least it worked. This was version 1.1.</p>

<p>Version 1.2 was an updated hardware schematic that added a 2N2222 transistor to
the mix. Using a transistor meant that the output from the Arduino&#8217;s pin was not
trying to power the LED but just telling a transitor to switch current on and off.
Since the transistor switches current significantly better than the output
pin of the Arduino I was able to extend the range for the IR blaster to about 15ft.
This change was inspired by open source schematics like <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/images/tvbgone/schematic.jpg">TV-B-Gone</a>.</p>

<p>Version 1.3 was to be the version with the web interface. This was where I realized
the limitations of the Arduino platform. I could not easily run a WiFi libray,
an IR library, and a web server off of an 8bit micro controller. I simply didn&#8217;t
have the resources.</p>

<p>I had considered a few alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run a webserver on my laptop and just send commands to/from the Arduino</li>
<li>Run a webserver on the internet and relay commands that way</li>
<li>Purchase a device like a <a href="http://raspberrypi.org/">RaspberryPi</a> or <a href="http://beagleboard.org/bone/">Beaglebone</a> and run the web
server on that device. Communicate with the Arduino perhaps via XBee or over WiFi.</li>
</ul>


<p>Ultimately I decided that adding a second device increased the complexity of the
project beyond what I wanted. So, I scrapped the idea of using an Arduino and I&#8217;m
starting over with a <a href="http://raspberrypi.org/">RaspberryPi</a>.</p>

<h4>Version 2: RaspberryPi</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://raspberrypi.org/">RaspberryPi</a> is a completely different beast than the <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a>. The <a href="http://raspberrypi.org/">RaspberryPi</a>
is about as powerful as a mobile phone. It&#8217;s got an ARM processor,
ethernet port, RAM, SD card for storage, and a bunch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Purpose_Input/Output">GPIO</a> pins for a hardware
interface.</p>

<p>So first up was finding an IR software package (designed for a Linux OS) that
could handle the transmission and receiving of IR signals. This lead me to
<a href="http://www.lirc.org/">LIRC</a> - the Linux Infrared Remote Control project. This project has been
around for a while, has a bunch of hardware schematics available (sending and
receiving) for it, and is open source. Perfect.</p>

<p>This lead me to getting LIRC working on my RaspberryPi. Luckily a chap who goes
by the name <a href="http://aron.ws/projects/lirc_rpi/">ar0n</a> has already opened a <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/pull/38">pull request</a> that adds preliminary
LIRC support to the RaspberryPi linux kernel.</p>

<p>So, at this very moment, I am attempting to recompile the RaspberryPi linux kernel
with LIRC support. Once this step is done I&#8217;ll wire up some hardware to test
sending and receiving. Once that works I should be back to &#8220;adding a web platform&#8221;
which will be significantly easier when powered by an entire Linux stack.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll post another update down the road once I&#8217;ve gotten this step working.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I had to determine if an image URL was properly rendering or not. Since
this image URL was provided by a user there was a chance that it had been
deleted or moved since they first set it. In that case I wanted to show a
different image - perhaps a &#8220;missing user&#8221; image - rather than just an empty
box.</p>

<p>My solution was to bind a callback to the <code>onerror</code> event that fires on an
<code>Image</code> object if the image source could not be loaded. By binding a callback
to this error I was able to replace a missing image with an image of my choice.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a sample implementation that binds a callback onto the <code>onerror</code> event:</p>

<p>As <code>onerror</code> support isn&#8217;t universal across every browser this should be
considered a visual enhancement for users with modern browsers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While trying to install LIRC on my RaspberryPi I ran into this error:</p>

<p><code>configure.ac:24: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_PROG_LIBTOOL</code></p>

<p>The solution that worked for me (on Debian Wheezy) was:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install libtools</code></p>

<p>Hope that helps someone else out there.</p>
